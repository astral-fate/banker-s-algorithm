The currently allocated resources matrix is given below:-

==> Out of 10 magnetic tape drives, 8 are allocated to P0, P1 and P3. Now, available is 2.

==> (Need matrix = max - allocation ) has been given below:-

=> Step 1:- The need of Process P1 is 1, which is less than the available = 2. Therefore, execute the process P1 and release the P1 allocated or holding resources = 2. Now, new available = 4 (i.e. 2 + 2 = 4)

=> Step 2:- The need of Process P0 is 4, which is equal to the new available = 4. Therefore, execute the process P0 and release the P0 allocated or holding resources = 4. Now, new available = 8 (i.e. 4 + 4 = 8)

=> Step 3:- The need of Process P2 is 7, which is less than the new available = 8. Therefore, execute the process P2 and release the P2 allocated or holding resources = 2. Now, new available = 10 (i.e. 8 + 2 = 10)
